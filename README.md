This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). [`MUI V6`](https://mui.com/) has been added with an example theme switcher component that avoids the dreaded white flash on page load.

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
